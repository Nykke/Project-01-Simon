### Technologies used:
- CSS
- Javascript
   - jQuery

### Simon User Stories:
- As a User, I will be able to initialize the game by pressing the "Start" button.
- As a User, I will be able to start and pause the timer
- As a User, I will be able to advance to the next level of the game after successfully completing the repetition sequence provided.
- As a User, I will be alerted if an incorrect repetition sequence has been entered and will repeat level until successful.


### Current Unsolved problems:
- When the user hits an incorrect petal the "if" statement runs the complete sequenceCheck before telling player the moves were incorrect.
- Win function needs work 


### Questions:
### How did you plan your project:

For my project I experimented with different shapes and then explored the idea of creating something that was a little less traditional for simon, that’s where I came up with the idea of having a mini garden scene.

For the functionality of the game I thought about what I wanted the game to do and what was needed to do those functions. However, my fault and downfall was not planning out my exact logic and steps.

### What would you do differently:

I would definitely have pseudo coded better, I think that was my downfall for this project. I kept stumbling around in the dark because I didn’t know where I wanted to go and what I wanted my feature to do and how it was going to do it.

### What are you most proud of:

I’m most proud of my CSS, I worked very hard on it and I’m happy with the results. I was thrilled when I got my petals to rotate around the center into their correct positions.
I'm also proud of the fact that I came back to this game and worked through the logic to get this game to actually work the way it's supposed to oppose to when I completed it in February, 2017 and it was only calling the first sequence.

### What did you learn:
- Pseudo coding is key, having a set plan is key when it comes to building something of this magnitude.
- I learned how to make and manipulate shapes in CSS to make objects and characters.
- When tackling a huge project, it's best to work on one feature at a time instead of thinking of it as a whole. This was my problem with the functionality.
- Know my limitations and the importance of splitting something as complex as this game into various logic sections to better track and understand what is going on.

### What would you do next:
- fix the incorrect conditional to not wait until the sequence is complete
- have the sky continuously move while game is open
- have game add more sequences in next round
- add the pause feature for whole game
