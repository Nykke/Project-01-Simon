Current Unsolved problems: <br />
At the moment I can only get the petals to light up once the "start" button is clicked. <br />
It logs the user clicked the petals, it just won't start a new sequence. <br />
When the user hits an incorrect petal the "if" statement gets overridden. <br />

Questions:<br />

What would you do differently:<br />

I would definitely have pseudo coded better, I think that was my downfall for this project. I kept stumbling around in the dark because I didn’t know where I wanted to go and what I wanted my feature to do and how it was going to do it.<br />

What are you most proud of:<br />

I’m most proud of my CSS, I worked very hard on it and I’m happy with the results. I was thrilled when I got my petals to rotate around the center into their correct positions.<br />

What would you do next:<br />
 —> fix the issue of where the sequence doesn’t show up after user clicks the correct petal <br/>
—> fix the issue of the user being able to click the incorrect petal and the alter “incorrect” doesn’t show up <br />
—> add the timer feature in javascript <br />
—> add the pause feature in javascript <br />
—> have game score code <br />
—> have game advance into next round by rotating the all of the petals <br />
—> have game add more sequences in next round <br />
—> have the sky continuous move while game is open <br />
-> add audio <br />

How did you plan your project:<br />

For my project I experimented with different shapes and then explored the idea of creating something that was a little less traditional for simon, that’s where I came up with the idea of having a mini garden scene.<br />

For the functionality of the game I thought about what I wanted the game to do and what was needed to do those functions. However, my fault and downfall was not planning out my exact logic and steps.<br />

What did you learn:
Pseudo coding is key, having a set plan is key when it comes to building something of this magnitude.<br />
I learned how to make and manipulate shapes in CSS to make objects and characters.<br />
When tackling a huge project, it's best to work on one feature at a time instead of thinking of it as a whole. This was my problem with the functionality. <br /> 

Simon User Stories:<br />
User will be given the option of a timed or untimed game.<br />
In the timed game, User will be scored, while in the untimed game no score will be collected.<br />
User will initialize the game by pressing the "Start" button.<br />
User will be able to pause game sequence after it has started by pressing the "Pause" button.<br />
User will advance to the next level of the game after successfully completing the repetition sequence provided.<br />
User will be alerted if an incorrect repetition sequence has been entered and will repeat level until successful.<br />
Each level of the game will increase in difficulty providing User with sufficient memory challenges.<br />
