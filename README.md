### Technologies used:
- CSS
- Javascript
   - jQuery

### Simon User Stories:
- User will be given the option of a timed or untimed game.
- In the timed game, User will be scored, while in the untimed game no score will be collected.
- User will initialize the game by pressing the "Start" button.
- User will be able to pause game sequence after it has started by pressing the "Pause" button.
- User will advance to the next level of the game after successfully completing the repetition sequence provided.
- User will be alerted if an incorrect repetition sequence has been entered and will repeat level until successful.
- Each level of the game will increase in difficulty providing User with sufficient memory challenges.


### Current Unsolved problems:
- At the moment I can only get the petals to light up once the "start" button is clicked.
- It logs the user clicked the petals, it just won't start a new sequence.
- When the user hits an incorrect petal the "if" statement gets overridden.

### Questions:

### How did you plan your project:

For my project I experimented with different shapes and then explored the idea of creating something that was a little less traditional for simon, that’s where I came up with the idea of having a mini garden scene.

For the functionality of the game I thought about what I wanted the game to do and what was needed to do those functions. However, my fault and downfall was not planning out my exact logic and steps.

### What would you do differently:

I would definitely have pseudo coded better, I think that was my downfall for this project. I kept stumbling around in the dark because I didn’t know where I wanted to go and what I wanted my feature to do and how it was going to do it.

### What are you most proud of:

I’m most proud of my CSS, I worked very hard on it and I’m happy with the results. I was thrilled when I got my petals to rotate around the center into their correct positions.


### What did you learn:
- Pseudo coding is key, having a set plan is key when it comes to building something of this magnitude.
- I learned how to make and manipulate shapes in CSS to make objects and characters.
- When tackling a huge project, it's best to work on one feature at a time instead of thinking of it as a whole. This was my problem with the functionality.


### What would you do next:
- fix the issue of where the sequence doesn’t show up after user clicks the correct petal.
- fix the issue of the user being able to click the incorrect petal and the alter “incorrect” doesn’t show up.
- add audio
- have the sky continuously move while game is open
- fix the body and footer overflow issue
- have game add more sequences in next round
- add the pause feature
- add the timer feature
